# Test Portal Frontend (Bootstrap + CSS)

## Quick start

1. Extract the zip
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

This frontend uses mock/static data for quizzes and a simple mock auth (stored in localStorage). Replace async actions in `src/store/authSlice.js` and use real API endpoints when ready.

Project structure is intentionally simple for beginners.
